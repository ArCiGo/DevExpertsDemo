# Test Plan

A short test plan for DevExperts assessment

## Objectives üéØ

The following items are going to be tested.-

* **Functional testing**
    * *API*
        * Automation testing of the following endpoints.-
            * https://api.demoblaze.com/addtocart
            * https://api.demoblaze.com/deleteitem
    * *UI*
        * Automation testing, in Firefox browser, for [DemoBlaze Product Store](https://www.demoblaze.com/index.html).-
            * Add an item to shopping cart.
            * Delete an item in shopping cart.

## Deliverables üíº

Automation framework, made in Java, with tests and test plan.

## Assumptions ü§î

* Since I am going to test a demo site that does not belong to **DevExperts**, I am assuming that the portal is working properly. If there are errors in the site, I will try to figure out how to contact the DemoBlaze team.

## Test Scenarios üíª

The task mentioned the use of BDD. Instead of adding a library of BDD to the project, which adds an extra layer of complexity to the project, making, in most of the cases, more difficult to maintain the project, I preferred to use meaningful names for the methods that demonstrate the user's actions when interacting with the application.

In the code for the UI tests, you may notice that I encapsulate the common tasks for both tests into a single method, that is called by the tests, and then I perform some assertions or I continue performing other tasks related to the shopping cart.

Due to the deadline, I am not performing tasks like to log in into the application and then do a purchase, or finishing a purchase.

The following scenarios were made from a user perspective. As you may notice, I used the **gherkin** language to write my tests.

```gherkin
Feature: BlazeDemo Product Store demo flow

# As a user, I should be able to add a product to the shopping cart without authentication.
Scenario: Add a product to the shopping cart
    Given I am on the Home page
    When I click on Samsung Galaxy S6
    And I click on Add to cart button
    Then the product is added to my cart
    And I am able to see it in the Cart page 

# As a user, I should be able to remove a product in the shopping cart without authentication.
Scenario: Remove a product in the shopping cart
    Given I am on the Home page
    When I click on Samsung Galaxy S6
    And I click on Add to cart button
    Then the product is added to my cart
    And I am able to see it in the Cart page
    Then I can delete it in my cart
```
## Risks ‚ò†Ô∏è

### Technical discoveries (bugs üïµÔ∏è üîé üêû)

During the exploratory testing of the UI and API, I found these interesting things

* Most of the Web elements does not have a proper ID or class, or does not have these attributes. Their values are auto generated by the transpiler.
* It seems that the cookie does not expire.
* Post and Delete endpoints just only throws a 200 status.

### Others üìÑ üíâ ‚ö†Ô∏è

* Site may not available during testing.
* Deadline.
